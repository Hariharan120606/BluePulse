# Single‑use plastics and other debris routinely wash into campus waterways and nearby beaches, degrading water quality, harming local wildlife (fish, crabs, shorebirds), and diminishing students’ sense of stewardship. While local NGOs and occasional university clubs organize one‑off beach clean‑ups, there’s no unified platform for tracking pollution hotspots, sharing real‑time data, or sustaining student engagement beyond isolated events.
